## 6. Functional Modules

### 6.1 Program Selection Module

Allows users to select a program (B.Tech, MBA, BBA) and dynamically displays related eligibility and career details.

Implementation:
- `<select>` dropdown element
- JavaScript `change` event listener
- DOM manipulation for displaying program details

---

### 6.2 Application Progress Tracker

Tracks completion of major application steps:

- Choose Program
- Check Eligibility
- Upload Documents
- Submit Application

Working:
- Uses checkbox inputs
- JavaScript calculates completion percentage
- Updates progress bar width dynamically

Formula:
(Completed Steps / Total Steps) × 100

---

### 6.3 Document Checklist

Displays common required admission documents:

- Mark Sheets
- ID Proof
- Entrance Exam Score
- Statement of Purpose

This improves usability but does not store or validate documents.

---

### 6.4 Deadline Countdown Timer

Displays remaining time until the application deadline.

Working:
- Uses JavaScript `Date()` object
- `setInterval()` updates countdown every second
- Stops when deadline passes

---

### 6.5 Chatbot Module

A simple rule-based chatbot.

Working:
- Converts user input to lowercase
- Checks for keywords (program, eligibility, documents, deadline)
- Returns predefined responses

This is not an AI chatbot but a keyword-based system.

---

### 6.6 Dark Mode Feature

Allows users to toggle between light and dark themes.

Working:
- Toggles a CSS class on the `<body>` element
- CSS updates background and text colors

---

## 7. User Workflow

1. User opens the website.
2. Selects a program.
3. Reviews eligibility criteria.
4. Tracks application steps using progress tracker.
5. Checks required documents.
6. Monitors deadline countdown.
7. Uses chatbot for quick assistance.

---

## 8. Testing Checklist

Ensure the following work correctly:

- Program dropdown updates information
- Progress bar calculates correctly
- Countdown timer updates properly
- Chatbot responds to valid keywords
- Dark mode switches themes
- Layout is responsive on different screen sizes

---

## 9. Deployment

Since this is a static project, it can be deployed using:

- Any static hosting platform

No server setup is required.

---

## 10. Limitations

- No real-time application tracking

---

## 11. Future Enhancements

- AI-powered chatbot integration
- Backend database connectivity
- Student login dashboard

- Full-stack implementation
- React.js version

---

## 12. Conclusion
